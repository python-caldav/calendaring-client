# A Calendaring and Task Client

The name of the library is not yet set in stone.  I thought of "calendar-client" and "calendaring-client", but I find it important with a name that makes it intuitive that it supports tasks and not only events.

## Background

I've been the maintainer of the Python CalDAV client package for many years now.  The ironic thing is that I started using the library because I "didn't want to get my hands dirty".  I had to do some fixes for the library to work towards my server, and soon enough the owner of the project passed me the maintainer hat.  To be honest, I think neither the CalDAV protocol nor the iCalendar format is particuarly good standards.  They are sort of the only open standards we have, so it's important to support them, but it's also important to support new and emerging standards.

There exists no good standards for tasks.  There are some industry standards, except for that the iCalendar standard offers support for task lists, but it's not a very good standard for it.  For instance, it's not very clear how to add information about time estimates and time spent on a task.

## What is it (going to be)?

This is intended to be a general python client for accessing task and calendaring information from various sources.  Version 0.1.0 it won't be much more than a wrapper for the CalDAV library already - but it will provide a clean, general and well-documented interface, it will support a clean, general and well-documented configuration file, with the intention to support other backends and not only CalDAV servers.

## Why it's important

Today one may have to choose different libraries for fetching calendaring information from different kinds of software.  I think it's important to have a "swiss army knife"-library for accessing calendars - one should not have to use different libraries for different calendar providers.  I'd like to support other standards in the CalDAV library, but it's a bit outside the scope for that library.

## Backends to be supported

* CalDAV, certainly.  It's (IMO) not a very good standard, but it is sort of the only standard for distributing and updating calendaring information.
* Support for "iCalendar feeds": It has become quite normal to offer users access to calendar data through iCalendar links.  It's much simpler than CalDAV, but offers less features.  Already several years ago I got requests from people wanting support for iCalendar feeds in the CalDAV library.  I think in the end I rejected it for being outside the scope of the CalDAV library.  It should be very simple to detect if a link is an iCalendar feed.  I split out an icalendar-searcher library while refactoring the CalDAV library - with this library it's possible to do client-side filtering and have a search-function that behaves the same towards CalDAV servers and an iCalendar feed.
* Support for local data files (.ical or .ics).  Those can be edited too.  The library should simply offer an API that works the same, regardless of weather the client is used towards a remote calendar server or towards a local selection of ical-files.
* Many mail systems comes bundled with calendar systems, and can interoperate with other systems by sending iCal data as email attachments.  The library should support sending iCal data as email attachments.  Perhaps even support accessing mailboxes through JMAP and/or IMAP.
* I've been playing a bit with Mobilizon lately.  It's basically a federated server designed for spreading calendar event information.  It's quite high on my list to support bidirectional support for this software.
* There are lots of proprietary systems offering calendaring and/or task management, but without supporting standards very well.  I'm not keen on working with those systems, but I'd happily accept pull-request for supporting any of them.
* There are many open source packages offering task management - like TaskWarrior.  It's worth looking into what can be supported.
* There are tools like GitLab, Gitea and Request Tracker - they are neither calendaring systems nor task list managers, still they are frequently used like that.  My employer is using both GitLab and Request Tracker, I would love to interface with them to fetch out task lists and calendaring information.
* TODO: research on what "OpenProject" is and if it may be a relevant backend.  (it looks a bit like some commercial solutions backed by heavy marketing investments slightly abusing the "open" keyword, abusing the .org domain space, and possibly just wanting to make quick money out of the EU digital sovereignity awakening,  but I may be very wrong - more research is certainly needed).

TODO: more research to be done.

## Relevant standards

* iCalendar - RFC 5545 with friends
* jCal - RFC 7265
* ActivityPub
* iTip - RFC 5546
* Emacs .org-mode

TODO: do more research to see if there are other standards

## Users

* I'm also developing plann - a CLI and a library for more advanced calendaring and task management.  It offers things that are out of the scope of both CalDAV and the calendaring-client, including "panic planning" where it's trying to fit the tasks with the highest priority into the available time before the deadlines.  It's using the CalDAV library, but I would like to support more than only CalDAV servers.
* Over the last years quite many CalDAV issues has come in through users of HomeAssistant.  I would like to reach out to the HomeAssistant community and see if they have use for something like this (unless they already have implemented something internally).
* I think that any project that either reads iCalendar feeds or uses the CalDAV client library could have use for such a "swiss army knife".
